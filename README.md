# Monoid Traits Options

This repository contains a brief overview of two implementation options for
monoids in the [GraphBLAS C++ API](https://graphblas.github.io/).

The main CPP file (which includes exposition in comments) is in [monoid_traits.cpp](https://github.com/BenBrock/monoid_traits_test/blob/main/src/monoid_traits.cpp).
